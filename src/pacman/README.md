# Pacman game with Fable!
Pacman finds himself in a grid filled with monsters ... this is probably the most complex sample here.
It involves rendering the maze, AI for the ghosts, user interaction and even playing sound effects.
The game has some brief commentary, but if you want to learn Fable, look at the other examples
first.

## Build and running the app

1. Install npm dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
2. Install dotnet dependencies: `dotnet restore`
3. Start Fable server and Webpack dev server: `dotnet fable npm-run start`
4. In your browser, open: http://localhost:8080/

Any modification you do to the F# code will be reflected in the web page after saving.
